# Recommendation Letters

This repository contains the recommendation letters Iâ€™ve received throughout my career. These letters highlight the feedback and experiences colleagues, mentors, and supervisors shared over the years.

## Structure

Each recommendation letter is stored in a separate folder, named after the company the person writing the recommendation belongs to. You'll find a PDF or text version of the letter in each folder.

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to keep a transparent and organized record of these recommendations and reflect on the milestones of my professional growth.
